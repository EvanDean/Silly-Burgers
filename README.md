# Silly-Burgers 
----------------
## Description
----------------
This project is a website for a fictional burger restaurant called Silly Burgers. The site is intended to be used to browse menu items and order food online. There are three pages to the website: The Home page, the Menu page, and the Custom Burger page. The Home page acts a landing page for users and provides links to the other two web pages. The Menu page displays all items for sale and allows users to add them to their cart. Finally, the Custom Burger page allows users to select ingredients to create their own burger. The inspiration for the name Silly Burgers comes from the saying silly bugger.
## Features
------------
Silly Burgers uses Javascript to interactivity in a couple of ways. Firstly, the slideshow on the home page allows users to scroll through different menu items. Secondly, on the Custom Burger page, JavaScript is used with HTML forms to make ingredients appear when the user selects them. 
## Languages Deployed

The Silly Burgers webiste uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Collaborators
